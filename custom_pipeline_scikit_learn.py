""" 
To write a custom pipeline in scikit-learn, you will need to create a class that
 extends the Pipeline class and implements the following methods:

__init__: Initialize the pipeline and the steps (transformers and/or estimators) it contains
fit: Fit the pipeline to the training data
predict: Use the fitted pipeline to make predictions on new data
score: Calculate the performance of the fitted pipeline on the given data and labels
fit_predict: Fit the pipeline to the data and then use it to make predictions
fit_transform: Fit the pipeline to the data and then transform it
Here is an example of a simple custom pipeline class:
"""
from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline

class CustomPipeline(Pipeline):
    def __init__(self, param1=1, param2=2):
        steps = [
            ("step1", CustomTransformer1()),
            ("step2", CustomTransformer2()),
            ("step3", CustomEstimator())
        ]
        super().__init__(steps=steps)
        self.param1 = param1
        self.param2 = param2
    
    def fit(self, X, y):
        # Fit the pipeline to the training data
        pass
    
    def predict(self, X):
        # Use the fitted pipeline to make predictions on new data
        pass
    
    def score(self, X, y):
        # Calculate the performance of the fitted pipeline on the given data and labels
        pass
    
    def fit_predict(self, X, y):
        # Fit the pipeline to the data and then use it to make predictions
        pass
    
    def fit_transform(self, X, y):
        # Fit the pipeline to the data and then transform it
        pass

""" 
Once you have implemented the class,
 you can create an instance of the pipeline and 
 use it like any other scikit-learn pipeline, for example:
"""
pipeline = CustomPipeline()
pipeline.fit(X_train, y_train)
predictions = pipeline.predict(X_test)
score = pipeline.score(X_test, y_test)

""" 
You can find more information and examples of custom pipelines in the scikit-learn
 documentation: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/developers/contributing.html#rolling-your-own-pipeline.
