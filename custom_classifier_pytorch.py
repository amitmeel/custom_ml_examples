""" 
To define a custom classifier in PyTorch, you will need to create a class that 
extends the torch.nn.Module class and implements the following methods:

__init__: Initialize the model and the layers it contains
forward: Define the forward pass of the model
compile: Compile the model with the specified optimizer, loss function, and metrics
fit: Fit the model to the training data
predict: Use the fitted model to make predictions on new data
evaluate: Evaluate the performance of the fitted model on the given data and labels
Here is an example of a simple custom classifier class:
"""
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class CustomClassifier(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, num_classes, param1=1, param2=2):
        super().__init__()
        self.param1 = param1
        self.param2 = param2
        self.layer1 = nn.Linear(32, activation="relu")
        self.layer2 = nn.Linear(num_classes, activation="softmax")
    
    def forward(self, inputs):
        # Define the forward pass of the model
        x = self.layer1(inputs)
        return self.layer2(x)
    
    def fit(self, x, y, optimizer, loss_fn, num_epochs):
        # Fit the model to the training data
        for epoch in range(num_epochs):
            # Forward pass
            y_pred = self.forward(x)

            # Compute and print loss
            loss = loss_fn(y_pred, y)
            print(f"Epoch {epoch}: loss = {loss:.4f}")

            # Zero gradients, backward pass, update weights
            optimizer.zero_grad()
            loss.backward()
            optimizer.step()
    
    def predict(self, x):
        # Use the fitted model to make predictions on new data
        return self.forward(x)
    
    def evaluate(self, x, y):
        # Evaluate the performance of the fitted model on the given data and labels
        y_pred = self.forward(x)
        return (y_pred == y).float().mean()

""" 
Once you have implemented the class,
 you can create an instance of the model
  and use it like any other PyTorch model, for example:
"""
model = CustomClassifier(num_classes=10)
optimizer = torch.optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)
loss_fn = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
model.fit(x_train, y_train, optimizer, loss_fn, num_epochs=10)
predictions = model.predict(x_test)
score = model.evaluate(x_test, y_test)
"""
