""" 
To define a custom cluster algorithm in scikit-learn, 
you will need to create a class that extends the BaseEstimator and
 ClusterMixin classes, and implements the following methods:

__init__: Initialize the model parameters and any other hyperparameters
fit: Fit the model to the data and cluster the samples
fit_predict: Fit the model to the data, cluster the samples, and return the cluster labels
fit_transform: Fit the model to the data, cluster the samples, and return the cluster centers
predict: Use the fitted model to predict the cluster labels for new data
score: Calculate the model's performance on the given data and labels
Here is an example of a simple custom cluster algorithm class:

"""
from sklearn.base import BaseEstimator, ClusterMixin

class CustomClusterAlgorithm(BaseEstimator, ClusterMixin):
    def __init__(self, param1=1, param2=2):
        self.param1 = param1
        self.param2 = param2
    
    def fit(self, X, y=None):
        # Fit the model to the data and cluster the samples
        pass
    
    def fit_predict(self, X, y=None):
        # Fit the model to the data, cluster the samples, and return the cluster labels
        pass
    
    def fit_transform(self, X, y=None):
        # Fit the model to the data, cluster the samples, and return the cluster centers
        pass
    
    def predict(self, X):
        # Use the fitted model to predict the cluster labels for new data
        pass
    
    def score(self, X, y):
        # Calculate the model's performance on the given data and labels
