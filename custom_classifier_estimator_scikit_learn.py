"""To write a custom classifier estimator in scikit-learn, you will need to create a class that extends the BaseEstimator and ClassifierMixin classes, and implements the following methods:

__init__: Initialize the model parameters and any other hyperparameters
fit: Fit the model to the training data
predict: Use the fitted model to make predictions on new data
score: Calculate the model's performance on the given data and labels
predict_proba: Calculate the probability of each class for each sample
predict_log_proba: Calculate the log probability of each class for each sample
Here is an example of a simple custom classifier estimator class:
"""
from sklearn.base import BaseEstimator, ClassifierMixin

class CustomClassifier(BaseEstimator, ClassifierMixin):
    def __init__(self, param1=1, param2=2):
        self.param1 = param1
        self.param2 = param2
    
    def fit(self, X, y):
        # Fit the model to the training data
        pass
    
    def predict(self, X):
        # Use the fitted model to make predictions on new data
        pass
    
    def score(self, X, y):
        # Calculate the model's performance on the given data and labels
        pass
    
    def predict_proba(self, X):
        # Calculate the probability of each class for each sample
        pass
    
    def predict_log_proba(self, X):
        # Calculate the log probability of each class for each sample
        pass



""" 
Once you have implemented the class,
 you can create an instance of the estimator and use it like any other scikit-learn estimator, for example:
"""
estimator = CustomClassifier()
estimator.fit(X_train, y_train)
predictions = estimator.predict(X_test)
score = estimator.score(X_test, y_test)

""" It is recommended to also implement additional methods such as
 get_params and set_params to make your estimator compatible wit
 h scikit-learn's hyperparameter tuning utilities. You can find more information and examples of custom classifiers in the scikit-learn documentation: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/developers/contributing.html#rolling-your-own-estimator.
