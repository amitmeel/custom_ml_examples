""" 
To write a custom loss class in TensorFlow,
 you will need to create a class that extends the
  tf.keras.losses.Loss class and implements the following methods:

__init__: Initialize the loss function and any other parameters
call: Define the forward pass of the loss function, computing the loss between the predicted values and the ground truth values
Here is an example of a simple custom loss class:
"""
import tensorflow as tf

class CustomLoss(tf.keras.losses.Loss):
    def __init__(self, param1=1, param2=2):
        super().__init__()
        self.param1 = param1
        self.param2 = param2
    
    def call(self, y_pred, y_true):
        # Compute the loss between the predicted values and the ground truth values
        loss = tf.reduce_mean(tf.square(y_pred - y_true))
        return loss
""" 
Once you have implemented the class, you can create an instance of the loss function
 and use it like any other TensorFlow loss function, for example:
"""
loss_fn = CustomLoss()
model = tf.keras.Sequential()
# Add layers to the model
model.compile(optimizer="sgd", loss=loss_fn)
""" 
You can find more information and examples of custom loss functions in the TensorFlow
 documentation: 
 https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/keras/custom_layers_and_models#using_a_custom_loss_class.
